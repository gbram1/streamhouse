# StreamHouse Phases - Complete Documentation Index

This document provides a comprehensive index of all development phases for the StreamHouse project, a high-performance distributed streaming platform inspired by Apache Kafka and WarpStream.

## Project Overview

StreamHouse is a distributed streaming platform that decouples compute from storage by leveraging S3-compatible object storage for data persistence while using lightweight agents for coordination and write operations.

**Key Design Principles**:

- Agent-based coordination for writes
- Direct storage reads for consumers
- High throughput with low latency

**Goal**: Transform unified server into distributed system with horizontal scaling

**Motivation**:
- Enable production-grade high availability
- Horizontal scaling for high throughput (>100K req/s)
- Geographic distribution across regions
- Fault isolation between API and storage layers

**Key Changes**:
- Separate API servers (stateless) from storage agents (stateful)
- Use gRPC Producer client for API → Agent communication
- Multiple API servers behind load balancer
- Multiple agents with partition assignment
- Configuration toggle: `STREAMHOUSE_MODE=unified|distributed`

**Architecture Comparison**:

*Current (Unified)*:
- Single process with REST API + gRPC + WriterPool
- Direct in-memory writes (~1ms latency)
- Good for: development, demos, moderate workloads

*Future (Distributed)*:
- API servers (stateless) → gRPC → Agents (WriterPool)
- Network-based writes (~3-5ms latency)
- Good for: production HA, horizontal scaling, high throughput

**When to Implement**:
- Production traffic exceeds single-server capacity
- High availability requirements (99.99%+)
- Need for horizontal scaling
- Multi-region deployment

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
