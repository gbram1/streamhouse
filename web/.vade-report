Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js

## Changes Implemented:

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package (v1.6.1) using npm
- Updated package.json to include the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json to ensure consistent dependency resolution

### 2. Analytics Integration
- Modified `app/layout.tsx` to integrate Vercel Analytics
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the ThemeProvider closing tag

### Modified Files:
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `/package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `/package-lock.json` - Updated lockfile with new dependency tree

## Implementation Details:

This is an App Router Next.js project (using the `app` directory structure), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `app/layout.tsx`. The component is placed inside the `<body>` tag, after the main application content, which is the recommended position for Vercel Analytics.

The Analytics component will automatically track page views and Web Vitals metrics when the application is deployed to Vercel.

## Verification:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors related to our changes
- ✅ Package successfully installed and added to dependencies
- ✅ Code follows existing project structure and patterns
- ✅ All changes are properly staged in git

## Notes:

- The build process encountered a pre-existing issue with lightningcss native bindings (unrelated to our Analytics changes)
- The linter reported pre-existing issues in other files, but no issues with the Analytics integration
- The Analytics component will only send data in production environments by default
- No additional configuration is needed for basic analytics tracking
