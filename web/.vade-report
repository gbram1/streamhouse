# Vercel Web Analytics Installation Report

## Summary
Vercel Web Analytics has **already been installed and configured** for this Next.js project. All requirements from the request have been fulfilled.

### ✅ Package Installation
- **Package**: `@vercel/analytics` version `^1.6.1`
- **Location**: Listed in `package.json` dependencies
- **Status**: Installed and available in node_modules

### ✅ Integration in App Router
Since this is an **App Router project** (using `app` directory), the Analytics component has been correctly integrated:

**File**: `app/layout.tsx`
- ✅ Import statement added: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- ✅ Component placed inside `<body>` tag
- ✅ Positioned after the main content (following `<ThemeProvider>` and its children)
- ✅ Properly integrated with existing providers (ClerkProvider, ThemeProvider, OrgProvider, QueryProvider)

### Code Implementation
```typescript
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider waitlistUrl="/waitlist">
      <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
        <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
          <ThemeProvider /* ... */>
            <OrgProvider>
              <QueryProvider>{children}</QueryProvider>
            </OrgProvider>
          </ThemeProvider>
          <Analytics />
        </body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

## Notes
